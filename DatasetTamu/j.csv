Redness, pain/tenderness, firmness, swelling and lumps/bumps occurred in roughly 80-90% of patients, bruising in 60% of patients, and itching and discoloration in roughly 35% of patients.''The percent of patients who maintained improvement with Juvederm at 24 weeks was 88-90% compared to 36-40% with Zyplast.

Forty-eight subjects returned after 36 weeks. Subjects who maintained improvement with Juvederm Ultra injectable gel was 75-81%.
